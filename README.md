# 🚀 Simplified Task Board - Frontend

Welcome to the **Simplified Task Board** frontend — a mini Trello/ToDo app to manage personal tasks divided into lists.  

---

## ✨ Overview

Built with **React.js** ⚛️ and **Vite** ⚡, this responsive app lets you:

- 🔐 Log in (JWT authentication)  
- 📋 View all task lists  
- 📝 View, create, edit, delete tasks in lists  
- 🔄 Change task status: *To do*, *In progress*, *Completed*  

State management via React Context API, routing with React Router, and styled with SCSS. Optionally uses a UI Kit like Bootstrap or Fluent UI for a clean look.

## 👤 Demo Credentials

Use these to log in immediately:

| Email              | Password |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| dev4side@milano    | 1234     |

You can create as many accounts as you want — all accounts, tasks, and lists are securely saved in the database.
For convenience, some demo accounts with preloaded tasks and lists are already available, so you can start testing right away without registering a new account (optional).
